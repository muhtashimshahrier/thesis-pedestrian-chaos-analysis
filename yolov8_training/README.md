# YOLOv8 Training – Road User Detection

This folder contains the code and related files used to train a custom YOLOv8 object detection model as part of my undergraduate thesis. The model was trained to detect 16 different vehicle classes from nighttime surveillance video footage.

## Overview

- **Base model:** YOLOv8l (`yolov8l.pt`)
- **Classes:** 16 total (e.g., Pedestrian, Rickshaw, Truck, etc.)
- **Training epochs:** 1500
- **Image size:** 640x640
- **Batch size:** 8
- **Framework:** [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com)
